### Description	
Skill Auto Balance is a simple concept. Place players on teams so the skill level of each team is approximately the same. In practice, doing this is very difficult. How should we define "skill" for each team, when they are made up of random players? We cannot do it without context.<br>	
<br>	
For that reason, this plugin relies on any external plugin to provide that context: a "rating" for each player. See the [modules](https://github.com/NotJustin/SkillAutoBalance/blob/master/README.md#modules) section for more detail on how this plugin works.<br>

### Changelog	
<details>	
 <summary>Expand for changelog</summary>
4.1.2 (too many minor changes that were only released in 'beta' between 3.2.5 and 4.1.2) - <br>
Force mp_autoteambalance and mp_limitteams to both be 0 (Thanks Penalte from alliedmods for the suggestion.<br>
Add convar sab_nobalancelastnminutes and sab_nobalancelastnrounds (Thanks to Razvann. from alliedmods for the suggestion)<br>
Fix logic/bugs where the plugin would balance at incorrect times (Thanks to Razvann. from alliedmods for helping me test this issue).<br>
Massive plugin restructure. Added a bunch of natives and forwards. Made the plugin modular.<br>
Since the plugin is restructured, you need to reinstall it fully.<br>
<br>
3.2.5 - <br>	
Added afk_manager4 support. The purpose of this is to fix a bug when using sab_forcejointeam "2" where clients would be moved to spectator by afk-manager4 and then be unable to rejoin a team.<br>	
<br>	
3.2.4 - <br>	
Properly check if a server has SourceTV before doing balance. Fixes bug where balance never occurs.<br>	
Do not move players to spectate if forcejointeam is disabled. Fixes bug where teammenu disappears after a few seconds and players must wait.<br>	
Only increment rounds passed after warmup ends. Balance after "n" rounds had been occurring 1 round too early.<br>	
Thanks to RÄƒzvan from alliedmodders for helping me debug and fix these issues.<br>	
<br>	
3.2.3 - <br>	
Added cvar_MaxTeamSize. It allows you to set a maximum team size. If the team sizes reach the max, players who join and are not admin are kicked. The admins who join can only spectate.<br>	
Fixed bug caused by last update, where players who teams were switched are immune for ~1 second at round start.<br>	
Added translations/phrases related to the new convar.<br>	
Fixed bug in issue #27 and #29<br>	
Fixed bug where players can still join spectate when disabled, by adding commandlistener for spectate.<br>	
<br>	
3.2.2 - <br>	
Fixed a bug where client scores were not being fetched properly.<br>	
Fixed a bug where GetAverageScore would not iterate through all players, resulting in an abnormally low average score.<br>	
Few small logic fixes.<br>	
Fixed name of levelsranks plugin to be levelsranks and not levelranks (thanks penalte on alliedmods).<br>	
<br>	
3.2.1 - <br>	
Fixed "sab_forcejointeam 1", which did not function properly.<br>	
<br>	
3.2.0 - <br>	
Split the plugin into different versions and removed sab_scoretype. See Installation section.<br>	
<br>	
3.1.5 - <br>	
Add HLStatsX support. Not sure if it works. Other changes in other versions, bugfixes, I'll go through commit history later and update this.<br>	
<br>	
3.1.1 - <br>	
Bugfixes:<br>	
This time, for sure, the correct amount of players will be swapped now. The bug is, there were duplicate clients being created in my list of clients. They were created after sorting. In my list of clients, there were some extra empty indices with 0's, and those 0's were being replaced with other client indices.<br>	
Also fixed other broken logic related to determining which players count as outliers.<br>	
<br>	
3.1.0 - <br>	
Bugfixes: <br>	
The correct amount of players will be swapped now. (closed issues #8 and #11)<br>	
Changes: <br>	
ForceJoinTeam convar changed to be an int and has 3 options now (disabled: 0, optional: 1, forced: 2) <br>	
Added new cvars to balance teams after map change and after a certain amount of players join/leave, or even to balance every single round.<br>	
Added a scale. Basically, lower scale = more outliers.<br>	
Translations updated.<br>	
<br>	
3.0.2 - <br>	
Bugfixes:<br>	
Scores are updated correctly.<br>	
BalanceSkill now only occurs after all scores are updated.<br>	
Disabling "teammenu" now only occurs after mapstart to prevent errors.<br>	
Balance should no longer cause teams to be horribly misbalanced. (imagine making an autobalance that just makes teams worse)<br>	
Spawn bug (may) be fixed after implementing "[CSGO] Auto Assign Team by SM9". Forcing players to join teams now uses ClientCommand for "jointeam". Thanks to MAMAC for showing me and both SM9+MAMAC for creating this. *I say "may" be fixed because the problem was already rare and so it is possible that I have just not seen or been notified of it happening when it does.*<br>	
<br>	
Changes:<br>	
Sorting method combines two ideas now. I call them "closest sums" and "alternating".<br>	
"Closest sums" makes the sum of points on both teams as close as possible.<br>	
"Alternating" alternates players between teams as it goes down the sorted list.<br>	
Read about it here: https://github.com/NotJustin/SkillAutoBalance/issues/2#issuecomment-636419874<br>	
Added support for Level Ranks<br>	
A fork of the plugin on github has support for NC RPG. I added but shortly after removed support because their include file has a lot of extra includes that I don't want to add as a requirement for this plugin to be installed.<br>	
BlockTeamSwitch convar changed to be an int and has 3 options now (disabled: 0, enabled but can spectate: 1, enabled with no switching at all: 2)<br>	
<br>	
3.0.1 - Changed sorting method when sorting by gameME or RankMe.<br>	
Using gameME, RankMe, LVL Ranks or NC RPG, get client's skill rather than their rank. This way, I can sort all of the score types in the same way.<br>	
<br>	
3.0.0 - I've been making lots of minor changes to this plugin over the last month. In general, it consists of function optimization, improving code readability, adding some features and trying out various solutions to the bug I've been trying to fix for awhile now (see Bugs section).

### Installation	
Put the three required plugins in your plugins folder (sab-core, sab-checkbalance, and sab-ctps).<br>	
Put any additional modules you want to add in your plugins folder (sab-admin, sab-blockteams, sab-messages).<br>	
Put sab.phrases.txt into your translations directory.<br>	
You need to be using at least one of the point systems, because players need some sort of "rating" for us to balance teams. If you do not use any at the moment, I made a basic one called [kpr_rating](https://github.com/NotJustin/KPR-Rating).<br>
