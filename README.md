### Changelog
3.0.1 - Changed sorting method when sorting by gameME or RankMe.
Using gameME, RankMe, LVL Ranks or NC RPG, get client's skill rather than their rank. This way, I can sort all of the score types in the same way.

3.0.0 - I've been making lots of minor changes to this plugin over the last month. In general, it consists of function optimization, improving code readability, adding some features and trying out various solutions to the bug I've been trying to fix for awhile now (see Bugs section).

You can see old changelog(s) at the alliedmodders thread.

### Installation
Extract this repository into your ./csgo/addons/sourcemod/ directory.
Compile it.
Put the compiled plugin in your plugins directory.

sab_minplayers (int | min 2 default 7)

sab_minstreak (int | min 0 default 6)

sab_scoretype (int | min 0 max 4 default 0)
"Formula used to determine player 'skill'. 0 = K/D, 1 = 2*K/D, 2 = K^2/D, 3 = gameME rank, 4 = RankMe rank"

sab_scramble (boolean | default 0)
"Randomize teams instead of using a skill formula"

sab_setteam (boolean | default 0)

### Bugs

(rare) when a player joins the server, they may spawn in the opposing team's spawn. As this occurs rarely, it is difficult for me to test whether I have fixed it or not. If you notice this happens, set these convars accordingly:
 * sab_blockteamswitch 0
 * sab_forcejointeam 0
 * sab_teammenu 1
